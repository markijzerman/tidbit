## Tidbit

Use Just Friends as a 'melodic' granular synth.

Tidbit uses Norns, Crow and JF (or W/) to create granular notes- addressing JF in a very rapid way as to use the absolute most of its six voices to create everything from rich sound beds to short scrapy percussive sounds. It applies the long history of granular synthesis to the six voices of Just Friends, starting from Democritus' atom theory all the way to Curtis Roads' writings on Microsound and beyond.

You curate four sets of five notes, or- randomise them in the PARAMS menu. Now, you can modulate the sound parameters on JF, skipping through different note-sets with E3 and divisions with E2.
