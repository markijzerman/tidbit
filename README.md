## Tidbit

Use Just Friends or a MIDI device as a 'melodic' granular synth.

Tidbit uses either Norns, Crow and JF (or W/) or MIDI to create granular notes - addressing the device in a very rapid way as to use the absolute most of JFs six voices or a MIDI device to create everything from rich sound beds to short scrapy percussive sounds. It applies the long history of granular synthesis to the six voices of Just Friends or a MIDI device, starting from Democritus' atom theory all the way to Curtis Roads' writings on Microsound and beyond.

You curate four sets of five notes, or- randomise them in the PARAMS menu. Now, you can modulate the sound parameters on JF, skipping through different note-sets with E3 and divisions with E2. On MIDI devices Tidbit relies on voice stealing.
